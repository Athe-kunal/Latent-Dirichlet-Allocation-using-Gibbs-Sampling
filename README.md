# LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION FOR TOPIC MODELLING AND FEATURE SPACE DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

## For both Task 1 and Task 2, we have a single file to run.

```
python task_1_2.py
```

### It will run everything for Task 1 and Task 2, that is topic modelling and the training. If you just want to run the training, then comment the lines from 23-28 for task_1_2.py file. We are saving the topics in `topicwords.csv` for Newsgroup data and `topicwords_artificial.csv` for artiicial data. The error plot is in `Newsgroup-20.png` and `Artificial.png` files. Also, the C_d and C_t matrices are saved in self-explanatory json files.
